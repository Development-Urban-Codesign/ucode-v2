### Ucode backend

#### Dev setup
Create a [python virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) in order to avoid version collision of third party libraries:
`make init`

Activate the virtual environment:
`source .venv/bin/activate`

If you later on want to deactivate the virtual environment, just execute `deactivate`.
